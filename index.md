# Memory Leaks Detection Research Information

## What are memory leaks?

"Memory leaks" or memory leaks are a common problem in many programs, including video games. They occur when a program does not properly free the memory it has allocated during its execution, which can lead to the program consuming more and more memory as it runs, until eventually all available memory on the system is used up and the program crashes or closes.

In video games, memory leaks can be especially problematic, as games often require large amounts of memory to function properly. If a game has a memory leak, it can lead to slow performance, stability issues, or even the game crashing.

To prevent memory leaks in video games and other programs, developers must ensure that they properly free up the memory they allocate during program execution, which involves identifying and correcting any memory management issues that may be present.
